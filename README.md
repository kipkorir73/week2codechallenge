## SuperHeroes API
## Description
This project is a Flask-based API for tracking heroes and their superpowers. It provides endpoints to manage heroes, powers, and their relationships. Additionally, there is a fully built React frontend application for testing the API's functionality.

## Project Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Install dependencies for the Flask backend:

 pipenv install 
 flask pipenv install
  sqlalchemy pipenv install 
  flask-sqlalchemy 
  pipenv install flask-migrate 
   Install dependencies for the React frontend:

npm install --prefix client

## Usage
You can run the Flask API on localhost:5555 by running:

 python app.py You can run the React app on localhost:4000 by running:

 npm start --prefix client

## Database Setup
This project uses a database to store heroes, powers, and their relationships. You need to set up the database by creating the necessary tables and seed data:

Create the database tables and seed data by running:
flask db upgrade python app/seed.py If you encounter issues with the provided seed file, you can generate your own seed data to test the application.
